/**
To see the change:
This query shows the result(s) for Game Names of games that are divided based on if they are released in a year before 2010 AND that it is supported on 'PC'.

The format is A = Game JOIN GName JOIN SupportedOn
              B = GName.Year < 2010 AND SupportedOn.Hardware_DeviceType = 'PC'

              So we query A/B = A1 - A2(where negated B)
